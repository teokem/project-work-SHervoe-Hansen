# Supporting information

### Working title: _Binding of Pyrophopshate and Citrate to Lysozyme and Their Role in Charge Reversal_
This is supporting information for an unpublished scientific manuscript by _Pasqueier, C., Bye, J., et al._ on the conformational flexibility of lysozyme in the presence of pyrophosphate. All figures within the analysis are publication ready and can be reproduced by running the provided Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`). For running the simulation we recommend you clone the repository, else the original dataset can be analyzed through the use of [Binder](https://mybinder.org), which will open the notebook in an executable environment which can be accessed [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/teokem/project-work-SHervoe-Hansen/master?filepath=Lyso_binding.ipynb).

The layout is as follows

- `data/` AMBER parameter, trajectory, and topology files.
- `Lyso_binding.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for conformational flexibility of Lysozyme in the presences of pyrophosphate by molecular dynamics.

## For the referees
Remember to consider the [project criteria](http://github.com/mlund/jupyter-course) and try to give constructive feedback that will improve the notebook.

For evaluation of the notebook we recommend the usage of Binder (using the provided link or shield) clearly all outputs and then run all cells for the display of Jupyter widgets.

## Notes for author
Please save your project when the course finished as we may delete it before the next course event.
